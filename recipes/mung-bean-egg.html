                <p>This recipe for a vegan egg mixture emulates the popular 'Just Egg' product. The egg mixture uses mung beans as a base and is quick, easy and cheap. </p>
                <p>The recipe is very versitile as you can use it to cook a vegan version of scrambled eggs or use it to create an omlette by adding your favourite. You can also add it to fried rice or stir fries just like scrambled eggs are traditionally added to those dishes.</p>
